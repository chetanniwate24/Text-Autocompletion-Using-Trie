    <div class="box">
        <p>A Trie (also called a prefix tree) is a type of search tree used to store associative data structures. A common application of a Trie is autocomplete, where the data is stored in such a way that it can efficiently support prefix-based queries.</p>
        <p>Each node in the Trie represents a single character, and each path from the root to a leaf node represents a word. By following the characters from the root, you can quickly determine whether a string is a valid prefix for any word stored in the Trie.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Properties of a Trie:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fast prefix search</li>
            <li>Efficient insertion and lookup of words</li>
            <li>Memory consumption depends on the number of keys stored</li>
        </ul>
